# RAG System Optimizations Guide

This document details the optimizations implemented in the RAG system components.

## 1. Document Processor Optimizations

### Async Processing

```python
async def process_documents():
await self.init_collection()
self.init_vector_store()
```

The document processor now uses asynchronous processing to improve performance. This is implemented using Python's `asyncio` library.

### Chunking Optimization

The chunking process has been optimized to reduce the number of tokens per chunk, which in turn reduces the computational load during indexing and querying.

### Embedding Optimization

The embedding model is now loaded asynchronously, which reduces the startup time and improves the responsiveness of the system.

### Batch Processing of Embeddings

- Batch processing of embeddings
- Reduces memory usage
- Improves processing speed

### Error Handling and Logging

```python
try:
    documents = reader.load_data()
    logger.info(f"Loaded {len(documents)} documents")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error loading documents: {str(e)}")
    raise
```
- Comprehensive error tracking
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Proper resource cleanup

## 2. Document Processing Optimizations

### Chunking Strategy
```python
parser = SentenceSplitter(
    chunk_size=1024,
    chunk_overlap=200,
    paragraph_separator="\n\n"
)
```
- Optimized chunk size for balance between context and performance
- Overlap prevents loss of context at chunk boundaries
- Paragraph-aware splitting for better semantic units

### Vector Store Setup
```python
vector_store = QdrantVectorStore(
    client=client,
    collection_name=collection_name,
    embedding_function=embeddings
)
```
- Efficient vector storage configuration
- Optimized for similarity search
- Proper connection management

## 3. Query System Optimizations

### Reranking Implementation
```python
self.reranker = SentenceTransformerRerank(
    model=rerank_model,
    top_n=3
)
```
- Improves result relevance
- Two-stage retrieval process
- Configurable top-k results

### Query Engine Configuration
```python
query_engine = self.index.as_query_engine(
    similarity_top_k=similarity_top_k,
    node_postprocessors=[self.reranker],
    response_mode="no_text"
)
```
- Optimized similarity search
- Post-processing for better results
- Memory-efficient response handling

## 4. System-Wide Optimizations

### Hardware Acceleration
```python
if torch.backends.mps.is_available():
    device = torch.device("mps")
```
- Metal Performance Shaders support for Apple Silicon
- Automatic hardware detection
- Fallback handling

### Resource Management
```python
async def close(self):
    await self.qdrant_client.close()
```
- Proper cleanup of resources
- Memory leak prevention
- Connection pool management

### Service Health Checks
```python
async def wait_for_services(timeout: int = 30):
    # Service health checks
```
- Ensures services are ready
- Configurable timeout
- Graceful error handling
